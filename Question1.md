You set your own threshold then choose any number as your product and start your multiplier at 1.
You want to make sure that your end product is greater than or equal to your set threshold.
The loop sets the product to the product * multiplier, and the multiplier increases by 1 every loop.
After the threshold is reacher, it prints out the final product, and how many iterations it went through.
