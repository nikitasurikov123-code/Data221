This creates information at strings inside a list in a dictionairy format.
First it makes a new dictionary then a loop loops through every string in the list to find its length.
Then you check the pairity, which is even if its length is divisible by 2, and odd if it isn't.
Finally it puts all the information into the dictionary, with the key being the string from the list, and the values are the information about the string.
